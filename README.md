# MTG-Scheme
This is an implementation of the card game Magic The Gathering (10th edition) in Scheme (R6RS).

All copyright for the rules of the game and images belong to Wizards of the Coast. 

The game has limited appeal to actually play the game since it implements an old version (10th edition) of the rules of the card game and can only be played locally.

However it does provide an example of a complex application written in Scheme and showcases different _patterns_ from _object-oriented design_ and _functional programming_.

How to use
----------

Install DrRacket from http://racket-lang.org/ and do a `File -> Install package` for the folder of the project.

When this is done, start the application by running `main.ss`.
